# PokéDex

This app is a guide to the first three generations of Pokémon, with detailed info about each one, including stats, types, and more. You can search for specific Pokémon, filter them based on various criteria, and sort them by different attributes. It’s perfect for Pokémon fans who want to explore and learn more about their favorite creatures.

## Features

* CoreData: It uses CoreData to save all the pokémons. 
* Detailed Pokémon Info: Get all the details on Pokémon from the first three generations.
* Shiny Pokémon: Check out how your pokémon looks like if it's shiny.
* Favorites: Mark Pokémon as favorites for quick access and filtering.
* Widget: Check out a new random Pokémon on your home screen at regular intervals.

# Widget

The widget is a cool feature that shows you a new random Pokémon right on your home screen every so often. It keeps things fresh and fun by surprising you with different Pokémon. You can also tap on the widget to open the app and see more details about the Pokémon.

This project is part of a course in which I am enrolled in @ [IOS 15 App Development with SwiftUI 3 and Swift 5 Udemy Course](https://farfetch.udemy.com/course/ios-15-app-development-with-swiftui-3-and-swift-5/).
